Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1. It is required when we need to collaborate with others.

Q2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2.It does not effect and create conflicts with the working state of the local copy

Q3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A3. Forks are used to clone repositories on git hub. Clones are used to create
copies of repo between different users and computers. Branch is used to create
a copy repo to add experimental changes, enhancements or feature
implementations.

Q4.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A4.It allows for comparison of changes between the local branch and the remote
branch

Q5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A5. Without git and github we would need to send files with changes to people
with whom we are collaborating, compare the changes to the files manually. It
would be harder to keep everyone in sync.
